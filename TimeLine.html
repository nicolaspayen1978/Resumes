                <h3>Founder & CEO - Positive Energy Ltd.</h3><a href="https://positiveenergylimited.wpcomstaging.com"><img src="https://nicolaspayen1978.github.io/web_perso/images/PE-Ltd-Color-Full-Logo-web.png" alt="Positive Energy Ltd" target="_blank" align="left" style="width: 15px; height: 15px; vertical-align: middle; margin-right: 5px;"></a>
                <p class="event-date">March 2017 - December 2023: From Vision to Market Leader: The Story of a Climate Fintech </p>
                <p>In 2017, fueled by a bold vision to transform the way sustainable energy projects are financed, I set out to build Positive Energy Ltd. from the ground up. I first gathered a group of experts through the INSEAD network to help me design the business and validate a concept using no-code prototypes.</p>
                <p>Then I recruited a world-class team ‚Äîincluding a co-founder- scaling to 9 full-time employees at peak capacity. We structured a solid governance framework, laying the foundation for a company that would disrupt the emerging markets and accelerate the energy transition.</p>
                <p>With a clear product vision, I led the design and engineering of our digital investment platform, turning a concept into a fully operational marketplace after 10 man-years of development executed with an outsourced engineering team from NYC and Kiev.</p>
                <p>To scale further, I spearheaded investor outreach and successfully raised angel and pre-seed funding, totaling $300k, ensuring growth through market fluctuations.
                <p>We were bootstrapped, ran lean start-up principles, and launched an aggressive go-to-market strategy, acquiring 750 companies and 2,000+ users across 36 countries within a year, positioning Positive Energy as a leader in Asia-Pacific‚Äôs sustainable finance sector.</p>
                <p>Commercial traction followed thanks to our business development team located in India and Vietnam. Through strategic business development, we unlocked $1.2 billion in potential project financing, securing six term sheets for our customers and generating $100K in revenue within 12 months from those.</p> 
                <p>Covid almost killed the company that was then unable to raise a proper seedround and didn't benefit from public support. After relocating to Europe and to relaunch the business not only in Asia but also in Europe, I co-developed GreenEU, a ‚Ç¨175M impact investment fund, forging a joint venture with European asset managers to accelerate the energy transition while supporting SMEs. During two years I worked with this asset management company to design the investment thesis, the impact analysis framework, and the fund's operations and key documents.</p>
                <p>Our efforts did not go unnoticed. We gained global recognition, winning awards and pitch competitions from the World Bank, Schneider Electric, Siemens, and Atos. We joined the largest start-up accelerator in Hong-Kong.</p>
                <p>From a bold idea to a recognized industry force, this journey has reinforced my passion for building scalable, impact-driven businesses that bridge finance and technology.</p>

                <p class="event-date">March 2017 - December 2022: A Launchpad for Disruptive Ventures.</p>
                <p>Based on my past experiences in intrapreneurship in large corporations, I created The Future Economy Studio while in Singapore as a startup studio designed to turn cutting-edge concepts into scalable businesses. Our mission: leverage digital technologies to reinvent industries, provide hands-on support to entrepreneurs, and help corporations navigate the early stages of digital transformation or venture building.</p>
                <p>Within its first five months, the studio rapidly prototyped and incubated four promising ventures, each addressing distinct market needs:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>üöÄ Interactive Video Projection for Out-of-Home Advertising ‚Äì A pioneering digital signage solution, transforming public spaces into interactive engagement platforms, developed by a team of 4.</li>
                    <li>‚öôÔ∏è Remote Monitoring & Asset Optimization for the Cement Industry ‚Äì A vibration sensor-based industrial IoT solution, designed to improve efficiency and reduce downtime, led by a team of 2.</li>
                    <li>üõí B2B E-Commerce & Outsourcing for Indirect Procurement ‚Äì By negotiating a minority equity investment in Blu-Buying Singapore, we co-developed a procurement outsourcing platform, with a team of 3 driving its growth.</li>
                    <li>üå± Positive Energy Ltd.: A B2B Marketplace for Renewable Energy Financing ‚Äì The studio‚Äôs most ambitious project, this fintech platform connected sustainable energy projects with investors, ultimately becoming a standalone success story.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                Through a structured process of ideation, validation, and execution, The Future Economy Studio proved that speed, agility, and a bold vision can turn disruptive ideas into investable businesses. As the Future Economy Studio was bootstrapped, and I faced difficulties in finding investors for the very early stage ventures I decided to focus my energy on one single venture to maximize my chance of success. This led to the accelerated development of Positive Energy Ltd.</p>

                <p>I spearheaded the global IoT strategy, overseeing initiatives from concept to commercialization, targeting $5 million in additional revenue through new digital product lines and services.</p>
                <p>To accelerate innovation, I launched and managed the IoT Innovation Lab in Singapore, assembling a multidisciplinary team of 5 experts. The lab focused on developing cutting-edge solutions for filtration and heavy equipment industries, leveraging emerging technologies to optimize operations.</p> 
                <p>For example we created the OurAir line of business for air quality monitoring solutions in Buildings. We also developed a 4G air filter sensors for heavy duty equipments used in Agriculture and Mining. I also developed an innovative monitoring and control solution for water treatment plants using membrane technologies.</p>
                <p>I implemented a structured venture design process, applying business model canvas, service design, rapid prototyping, proof of value validation, design-to-cost optimization, and go-to-market strategies to bring IoT-enabled solutions to market.</p>
                <p>Under my leadership, the team developed IoT-powered smart devices, including an air quality monitoring system and predictive maintenance solutions for industrial filtration. These innovations utilized technology like AWS IM, AWS Lambda, React, and Docker, ensuring scalable, secured, and efficient deployments.</p>
                <p>I worked closely with Corporate Venture teams, scooting, evaluating and integrating start-up technologies to create synergies with MANN+HUMMEL‚Äôs product lines, enhancing both product differentiation and operational efficiency.For example, I pushed in 2016 for an early investment in Breezometer, a airquality data provider. A company acquired by Google in 2021 for $200Mln.</p> 
                <p>Beyond product innovation, I advised manufacturing units on IoT adoption and Industry 4.0 best practices, driving digital transformation across global operations. I also triggered the creation of a data science team to leverage inhouse data (from ERPs and other systems) to improve business decisions</p>
                <p>Reporting directly to the Chief Technology Officer, I played a pivotal role in shaping the company‚Äôs digital future, managing a high-performing IoT team in Singapore and ensuring that MANN+HUMMEL remained at the forefront of smart industrial solutions.</p>
