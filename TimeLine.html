                <p class="event-date">2025 – Present: Building “Your AI, Your Voice” (Human-Enhanced Agents)</p>
                <p>
                    After years at the intersection of energy, digital platforms, and sustainable finance,
                    I started HEA World to solve a recurring problem: organizations need conversational AI that is
                    <em>contextualized, governable, and publishable</em> — not a generic chatbot.
                </p>
                <p>
                    HEA World is an infrastructure layer to create and deploy <strong>Human-Enhanced Agents (HEAs)</strong>:
                    specialized agents grounded in curated content, with a clear lifecycle (draft → beta → preview → published),
                    strong data protection, and easy embedding.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Designed end-to-end architecture: ingestion → extraction → enrichment → embeddings → chat engine → widget/AskBar.</li>
                    <li>Implemented governance & safety: encrypted artifacts, controlled publishing, domain restrictions, auditability.</li>
                    <li>Shipped early HEAs for associations, agencies, and education organizations; iterated from real usage.</li>
                    <li>Can you build a deeptech company alone thanks to AI? I’m testing this in 2025 and 2026 — not by choice, but because it seems the most efficient way to do it.</li>

                <h3>Transition Year — AI R&amp;D, Product Incubation, Strategic Reset</h3>
                <p class="event-date">2024: From climate finance platform-builder to AI agents infrastructure-builder</p>
                <p>
                    2024 was a deliberate transition year: I stepped back from operations to consolidate lessons learned,
                    study fast-moving AI capabilities, and prototype what became HEA World.
                    I also took time to formalize my financial/investment learning and return on experience by shaping the 4Gs
                    investment thesis and developing the KOI portfolio and stock analysis tool.
                    This was also an opportunity for me to code again by learning Python and using AI/ChatGPT to accelerate my work.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        After the KOI project, and with greater confidence in my coding abilities and aware of the new opportunities offered by AI,
                        I started developing my own website from scratch. I then began a pet project to create an AI agent able to answer questions
                        related to the energy transition the way I would answer them. This hobby project forced me to deep dive into LLM product patterns:
                        retrieval, evaluation, guardrails, data governance, and cost/latency trade-offs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In March 2025, the prototype of NicoAI works and is able to answer questions the way I would, on my behalf.
                        This is the seed of HEA-World creation. I thought I was done with entrepreneurship after Positive Energy Ltd. I was wrong.

                <p class="event-date">
                    March 2017 – December 2023: From Vision to Market Leader — the story of
                    <a href="https://web-perso.vercel.app/docs/aboutPositiveEnergyLtd.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Positive Energy Ltd</a>, a Climate Fintech
                </p>

                <p>
                    In 2017, while living in Singapore, fueled by a bold vision to transform the way sustainable energy projects are financed,
                    I set out to build Positive Energy Ltd from the ground up. I first gathered a group of experts through the INSEAD network
                    to help me design the business and validate a concept using no-code prototypes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then I recruited a world-class team — including a co-founder — scaling to 9 full-time employees at peak capacity.
                    We structured a solid governance framework, laying the foundation for a company that would disrupt emerging markets
                    and accelerate the energy transition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With a clear product vision, I led the design and engineering of our digital investment platform, turning a concept into
                    a fully operational marketplace after 10 man-years of development executed with an outsourced engineering team from NYC and Kyiv.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To scale further, I spearheaded investor outreach and successfully raised angel and pre-seed funding, totaling $300k,
                    ensuring growth through market fluctuations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We were bootstrapped, ran lean start-up principles, and launched an aggressive go-to-market strategy, acquiring 750 companies and
                    2,000+ users across 36 countries within a year, positioning Positive Energy as a leader in Asia-Pacific’s sustainable finance sector.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Commercial traction followed thanks to our business development team located in India and Vietnam. Through strategic business development,
                    we unlocked $1.2 billion in potential project financing, secured six term sheets for our customers, and generated $100K in revenue within
                    12 months from those.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Covid almost killed the company. We were unable to raise a proper seed round and did not benefit from public support.
                    After relocating to Europe (Amsterdam) and attempting to relaunch not only in Asia but also in Europe, I co-developed
                    <a href="https://web-perso.vercel.app/docs/greenEU.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GreenEU</a>, a €175M impact investment fund concept,
                    forging a joint venture with European asset managers to accelerate the energy transition while supporting SMEs.
                    During two years I worked with this asset management company to design the investment thesis, the impact analysis framework,
                    and the fund's operations and key documents.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our efforts did not go unnoticed. We gained global recognition, winning awards and pitch competitions from the World Bank,
                    Schneider Electric, Siemens, and Atos. We joined the largest start-up accelerator in Hong Kong.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From a bold idea to a recognized industry force, this journey reinforced my passion for building scalable, impact-driven businesses
                    that bridge finance and technology.

                <p class="event-date">March 2017 – December 2022: A Launchpad for Disruptive Ventures</p>
                <p>
                    Based on my past experiences in intrapreneurship in large corporations, I created The Future Economy Studio while in Singapore as a startup studio
                    designed to turn cutting-edge concepts into scalable businesses. Our mission: leverage digital technologies to reinvent industries, provide hands-on
                    support to entrepreneurs, and help corporations navigate the early stages of digital transformation or venture building.
                </p>
                <p>Within its first five months, the studio rapidly prototyped and incubated four promising ventures, each addressing distinct market needs:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>🚀 Interactive Video Projection for Out-of-Home Advertising — a digital signage solution turning public spaces into interactive platforms (team of 4).</li>
                    <li>⚙️ Remote Monitoring &amp; Asset Optimization for the Cement Industry — vibration sensor-based industrial IoT (team of 2).</li>
                    <li>🛒 B2B E-Commerce &amp; Outsourcing for Indirect Procurement — with Blu-Buying Singapore, co-developing a procurement outsourcing platform (team of 3).</li>
                    <li>🌱 Positive Energy Ltd. — a B2B marketplace for renewable energy financing, later becoming a standalone story.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Through a structured process of ideation, validation, and execution, The Future Economy Studio proved that speed, agility, and a bold vision can turn
                    disruptive ideas into investable businesses. As the studio was bootstrapped and I faced difficulties finding investors for very early-stage ventures,
                    I decided to focus my energy on one single venture to maximize the chance of success — which led to the accelerated development of Positive Energy Ltd.

                </h3>
                <p class="event-date">March 2016 – March 2017: Driving digital transformation for a leading automotive supplier</p>
                <p>
                    I spearheaded the global IoT strategy, overseeing initiatives from concept to commercialization, targeting $5 million in additional revenue
                    through new digital product lines and services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To accelerate innovation, I launched and managed the IoT Innovation Lab in Singapore, assembling a multidisciplinary team of 5 experts.
                    The lab focused on developing cutting-edge solutions for filtration and heavy equipment industries, leveraging emerging technologies to optimize operations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, we created the OurAir line of business for air quality monitoring solutions in buildings. We also developed 4G air filter sensors
                    for heavy-duty equipment used in agriculture and mining. I also developed an innovative monitoring and control solution for water treatment plants
                    using membrane technologies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I implemented a structured venture design process, applying business model canvas, service design, rapid prototyping, proof of value validation,
                    design-to-cost optimization, and go-to-market strategies to bring IoT-enabled solutions to market.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Under my leadership, the team developed IoT-powered smart devices, including an air quality monitoring system and predictive maintenance solutions
                    for industrial filtration. These innovations utilized technologies like AWS IoT, AWS Lambda, React, and Docker, ensuring scalable, secured, and efficient deployments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I worked closely with Corporate Venture teams, scouting, evaluating, and integrating start-up technologies to create synergies with MANN+HUMMEL’s product lines.
                    For example, I pushed in 2016 for an early investment in BreezoMeter, an air quality data provider — later acquired by Google in 2021 for ~$200M.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond product innovation, I advised manufacturing units on IoT adoption and Industry 4.0 best practices, driving digital transformation across global operations.
                    I also triggered the creation of a data science team to leverage in-house data (from ERPs and other systems) to improve business decisions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Reporting directly to the Chief Technology Officer, I played a pivotal role in shaping the company’s digital future, managing a high-performing IoT team in Singapore
                    and ensuring that MANN+HUMMEL remained at the forefront of smart industrial solutions.

                <p class="event-date">April 2013 – October 2015: Expanding Market Reach &amp; Driving Growth</p>
                <p>
                    In this period, I occupied a dual role as APAC &amp; Middle East Channel Director and Commercial Director.
                    I led the channel strategy for a €1.4B Building Automation &amp; Power Systems business unit and spearheaded initiatives supporting €200M in revenue across APAC and the Middle East.
                    I implemented the EcoExperts program, enhancing partner performance through incentives, training programs, and performance reviews, increasing engagement across system integrators in the region.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To strengthen Schneider Electric’s presence, I orchestrated the region’s first multi-specialty partner event, attracting 100+ companies and fostering collaborations that led to greater channel efficiency and sales growth.
                    I developed and launched channel marketing and sales support programs (including early YouTube product tutorials for the group), improving sales cycle times and partner satisfaction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Managing a distributed team across APAC-MENA, I directly led two regional managers (India and Hong Kong) and indirectly eight country-level channel managers, ensuring a cohesive and high-performance sales strategy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In parallel, I managed a €25M P&amp;L and delivered a turnaround from -15% to +15% YoY growth, while sustaining gross margins above 50%.
                    I oversaw sales and operational marketing for Light and Room Control solutions, aligned regional execution with the product roadmap, and negotiated targets, resources, and initiatives with country Business VPs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I led strategic partnerships with local telecom and utility providers (HK, SG), introducing connected smart home and HVAC control solutions into key Asian markets.
                    By championing business model simulations and venture design workshops, I refined partnership viability and optimized go-to-market strategies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With a team of 5 direct reports and 80 indirect sales professionals across Asia, I scaled operations, strengthened partnerships, and reinforced Schneider Electric’s leadership in smart home and building automation solutions.

                <p>
                    The prototype and business concept convinced the executive team. Our Smart Home project became one of the group’s internal start-ups:
                    a global cross-business-units initiative, strategic for the future of Schneider Electric.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As part of the leadership team for the Connected Home program and a member of the management team of the line of business in charge of the core system,
                    I co-led the development of residential solutions for the US, EU, and AUS markets, backed by a €50M investment.
                    I spearheaded the launch of Wiser, a next-gen energy management smart home solution, managing a cross-functional senior team and a €5M annual budget from prototyping to commercial launch.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I led the development of a brand-new residential tech platform integrating Zigbee Energy Box, M2M communication, cloud, web, and mobile applications.
                    This architecture required integrating multiple components sourced (message broker, cloud infra, energy box) or developed in-house (firmware/software).
                    Most of the production was located in low-cost countries (China for HW manufacturing, India for IT services) to ensure proper margins.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I played a critical role in releasing the first Demand Side Management API for utilities (ENGIE, GRDF), contributing to France’s Greenlys Smart Grid demonstrator.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fun fact: I hired the first full-time UI/UX designer of the group, released early Zigbee HA solutions, and helped push early IoT connectivity patterns relying on message brokers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Managing a global team of 6 across France, Denmark, and India, and indirectly overseeing 20+ additional professionals,
                    I delivered a high-quality, cost-effective smart home solution that reinforced Schneider Electric’s leadership in home automation and energy management.

                    EDF was looking for an industrial partner to develop a new connected solution for residential customers to help them save energy while providing demand services.
                    Schneider Electric was interested. After a few months of development, EDF decided to stop the project. Schneider Electric decided to continue anyway.

                <p>
                    In this role, I was part of a small innovation team responsible for technical development and feasibility analysis of this connected residential energy management system,
                    leading a cross-functional team across five countries.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I led feasibility studies and market research for a B2C smart home offering, integrating analytics, GPRS/xDSL connectivity, and an open innovation model,

                </p>
                <p>
                    To optimize development cycles, I introduced agile methodologies, ensuring alignment with emerging market trends and new B2C channel opportunities.

                    I ensured global collaboration and delivered a first mock-up of the system.

                <p>
                    As part of an acceleration program for young talent, I was sent to Sweden in a newly acquired entity to support a major renewal of a leading offer.
                    I played a pivotal role in driving business strategy, market expansion, and product innovation for Europe’s mini-trunking and cable management systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I managed the offer and business strategy for Europe’s mini-trunking segment, ensuring pricing, product positioning, and market approach aligned with business objectives.
                    I worked closely with Nordic commercial teams, supporting pricing, channel/product marketing, adaptations, and active portfolio management.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I helped define the strategic roadmap for Sweden, Schneider Electric’s primary Nordic market, overseeing a €30M revenue portfolio.
                    The line of business VP asked me to lead financial modeling and business plan development for the strategic program,
                    shaping investment decisions (manufacturing site selection, range optimization, pricing strategy).
                    I co-defined requirements for a €30M business renewal program and helped secure a €6.5M investment to modernize the core range for the region (Optiline 45 and 50).

                    As Deputy Marketing Manager in Grenoble, I contributed to market analysis, strategic positioning, and upstream marketing initiatives for Industrial Performance Services,
                    focusing on the emerging Manufacturing Execution System (MES) market.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I conducted an in-depth market analysis, benchmarking Schneider Electric’s MES initiatives (often small start-ups at the time) against competitors across verticals,
                    including Food &amp; Beverage, Pharma, Water, and Mining.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Based on the analysis, I developed strategic recommendations influencing positioning and segmentation in high-growth industries.

                <p>
                    Fun fact: my recommendation at the time was to create specific MES offers per vertical through specialized acquisitions.
                    Two targets I liked were Wonderware and Ampla, both later consolidated through AVEVA (acquired by Schneider Electric in 2017 for $3.4B).
