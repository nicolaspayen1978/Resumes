                <h3>Founder & CEO - Positive Energy Ltd.</h3>
                <p class="event-date">March 2017 - December 2023: From Vision to Market Leader: The Story of Positive Energy</p>
                <p>In 2017, fueled by a bold vision to transform the way sustainable energy projects are financed, I set out to build Positive Energy Ltd. from the ground up. I first gathered a group of experts through the INSEAD network to help me design the business and validate a concept using no-code prototypes.</p>
                <p>Then I recruited a world-class team ‚Äîincluding a co-founder- scaling to 9 full-time employees at peak capacity. We structured a solid governance framework, laying the foundation for a company that would disrupt the emerging markets and accelerate the energy transition.</p>
                <p>With a clear product vision, I led the design and engineering of our digital investment platform, turning a concept into a fully operational marketplace after 10 man-years of development executed with an outsourced engineering team from NYC and Kiev.</p>
                <p>To scale further, I spearheaded investor outreach and successfully raised angel and pre-seed funding, totaling $300k, ensuring growth through market fluctuations.
                <p>We were bootstrapped, ran lean start-up principles, and launched an aggressive go-to-market strategy, acquiring 750 companies and 2,000+ users across 36 countries within a year, positioning Positive Energy as a leader in Asia-Pacific‚Äôs sustainable finance sector.</p>
                <p>Commercial traction followed thanks to our business development team located in India and Vietnam. Through strategic business development, we unlocked $1.2 billion in potential project financing, securing six term sheets for our customers and generating $100K in revenue within 12 months from those.</p> 
                <p>Covid almost killed the company that was then unable to raise a proper seedround and didn't benefit from public support. After relocating to Europe and to relaunch the business not only in Asia but also in Europe, I co-developed GreenEU, a ‚Ç¨175M impact investment fund, forging a joint venture with European asset managers to accelerate the energy transition while supporting SMEs. During two years I worked with this asset management company to design the investment thesis, the impact analysis framework, and the fund's operations and key documents.</p>
                <p>Our efforts did not go unnoticed. We gained global recognition, winning awards and pitch competitions from the World Bank, Schneider Electric, Siemens, and Atos. We joined the largest start-up accelerator in Hong-Kong.</p>
                <p>From a bold idea to a recognized industry force, this journey has reinforced my passion for building scalable, impact-driven businesses that bridge finance and technology.</p>

                <h3>Founder & Managing Director - Future Economy Studio Pte Ltd.</h3>
                <p class="event-date">March 2017 - December 2022: The Future Economy Studio: A Launchpad for Disruptive Ventures.</p>
                <p>In a rapidly evolving digital landscape, The Future Economy Studio was founded as an innovation hub‚Äîa startup studio designed to turn cutting-edge concepts into scalable businesses. Our mission: leverage digital technologies to reinvent industries, provide hands-on support to entrepreneurs, and help corporations navigate the early stages of digital transformation.</p>
                <p>Within its first five months, the studio rapidly prototyped and incubated four promising ventures, each addressing distinct market needs:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>üöÄ Interactive Video Projection for Out-of-Home Advertising ‚Äì A pioneering digital signage solution, transforming public spaces into interactive engagement platforms, developed by a team of 4.</li>
                    <li>‚öôÔ∏è Remote Monitoring & Asset Optimization for the Cement Industry ‚Äì A vibration sensor-based industrial IoT solution, designed to improve efficiency and reduce downtime, led by a team of 2.</li>
                    <li>üõí B2B E-Commerce & Outsourcing for Indirect Procurement ‚Äì By negotiating a minority equity investment in Blu-Buying Singapore, we co-developed a procurement outsourcing platform, with a team of 3 driving its growth.</li>
                    <li>üå± Positive Energy Ltd.: A B2B Marketplace for Renewable Energy Financing ‚Äì The studio‚Äôs most ambitious project, this fintech platform connected sustainable energy projects with investors, ultimately becoming a standalone success story.</li>
                </ul>
                Through a structured process of ideation, validation, and execution, The Future Economy Studio proved that speed, agility, and a bold vision can turn disruptive ideas into investable businesses. As the Future Economy Studio was bootstrapped, and I faced difficulties in finding investors for the very early stage ventures I decided to focus my energy on one single venture to maximize my chance of success. This led to the accelerated development of Positive Energy Ltd.
